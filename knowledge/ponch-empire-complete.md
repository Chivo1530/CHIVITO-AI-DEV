"AI will take over the world, so let's start playing ball. I want to be a Swiss Army knife for online businesses - not just automation, but a complete business partner."

## THE PONCH APPROACH
**Multi-Service Empire Strategy**:
1. Physical Products: DTF printing, embroidery, screen printing (clothing brand expansion)
