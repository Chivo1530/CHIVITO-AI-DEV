# CHIVITO AI - Testing Results and Progress

## Testing Protocol
- MUST READ and ADHERE to this testing protocol
- MUST test BACKEND first using `deep_testing_backend_v2`
- After backend testing, STOP to ask user whether to test frontend
- ONLY test frontend if user explicitly asks
- NEVER invoke `deep_testing_frontend_v2` without user permission
- ALWAYS take MINIMUM steps when editing this file
