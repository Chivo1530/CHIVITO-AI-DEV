Subject: IMMEDIATE TOKEN REFUND REQUEST - Multiple Platform Failures

Dear Emergent Support Team,

I am writing to demand an immediate full refund of my tokens due to multiple critical platform failures that have rendered your service completely unusable.

**PAYMENT DETAILS:**
- Job ID: b807ab36-3ab5-4415-9777-f7f934222980
- Tokens Purchased: [ENTER AMOUNT]
- Payment Date: [ENTER DATE]

**DOCUMENTED PLATFORM FAILURES:**

1. **DEPLOYMENT API FAILURE**
   - Error: "api.emergent.sh/jobs/v0/deploy Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 400"
   - Multiple deployment attempts all failing with 400 Bad Request
   - No error logs or meaningful error messages provided

2. **ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES UI COMPLETELY BROKEN**
   - "Env Variables" dropdown completely non-functional
   - Cannot click or expand the environment variables section
   - Critical feature required for deployment is completely inaccessible

3. **GITHUB SAVE FUNCTIONALITY BROKEN**
   - "Save to GitHub" feature failing
   - Unable to save completed work to version control
   - Critical backup functionality non-operational

4. **CORE PLATFORM SERVICES FAILING**
   - Console shows repeated API failures and connection errors
   - WebSocket connections failing (ws://localhost:8098/)
   - Multiple 502 Bad Gateway errors

**BUSINESS IMPACT:**
- Hours of development time wasted fighting platform bugs
- Unable to deploy completed application despite successful local builds
- Cannot demonstrate value to clients due to platform failures
- Paid for services that are fundamentally broken

**TECHNICAL EVIDENCE:**
My application builds successfully (Next.js 14.0.4, 25/25 pages generated) with no code errors. The failures are entirely on your platform's infrastructure, not user error.

**IMMEDIATE RESOLUTION REQUIRED:**

I demand either:
1. **FULL TOKEN REFUND** for services that were paid for but cannot be used
2. **IMMEDIATE PLATFORM FIX** with working deployment and environment variable functionality
3. **ESCALATION TO TECHNICAL MANAGEMENT** for emergency resolution

This level of platform instability is unacceptable for a paid service. I have documented evidence of all failures and expect immediate action.

I will be sharing this experience publicly if not resolved within 24 hours.

**EVIDENCE ATTACHED:**
- Console error screenshots
- Failed deployment attempt logs
- Documentation of UI functionality failures
